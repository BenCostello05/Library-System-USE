# Library-System-USE
This is a Library System that has been extended and tested in UML Specification Environment (USE) collaboratively as part of a Software Engineering 2 project. I worked on adding extra use cases to the System by implementing reserving a book, borrowing a reserved book and cancelling a reservation and confirming it worked alongside the already working use cases in the system. The Library system is able to keep track of what users are borrowing and what books are reserved and by whom. This was all created in USE. USE allows you to bring UML models such as class diagrams to life. You can create objects and send messages between them to simulate and test their interaction. It has it's own action language called SOIL which is easier to implement compared to a OOP programming language like Java. You can explore class diagrams to see the system structure, sequence diagrams to see object interactions, object diagrams and state machines to understand the object's behaviour. The PDF file called Assignment is my report I created for the project. Inside it you can find a description of the extra use case scenarios and how they work, preconditions, postconditions, invariants, the testing that was carried out on the whole system and finally screenshots of class diagrams, sequence diagrams,object diagrams and state machines.
