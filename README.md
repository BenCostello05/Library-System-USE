# Library-System-USE
This is a Library System that has been extended and tested in UML Specification Environment (USE) collaboratively as part of a Software Engineering 2 project. I worked on adding extra use cases to the System by implementing reserving a book, borrowing a reserved book and cancelling a reservation and making sure it worked alongisde the already working usecases in the system. The Library system is able to keep track of what users are borrowing books and what books are reserved and by who. This was all created in USE. USE allows you to bring UML models such as class diagrams to life. You can create object and send messages between them to simulate and test the interactaction between them. It has it's own action langauge called SOIL which is much simplier to implement comapred to a OOP programming language like Java. You can explore class digrams to see the system structure, sequence diagrams to see object interactions, object diagrams and statemachines to undertsand the object's behaviour. The PDF file called Assignment is my report I created for the project. Inside it you can find a descirtption of the extra use case secnarios and how they work, preconditions, postconditions, invariants, the testing that was carried out on the whole system and finally screenshots of class diagrams, sequence diagrams,object diagrams and statemachines.
